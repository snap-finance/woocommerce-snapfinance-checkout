## WooCommerce Snapfinance checkout

## Description

Snap Finance checkout provides eCommerce merchants with a set of APIs to offer an in-context finance option to their customers at the time of checkout.
The Snap JavaScript library, aka "snap-sdk (client)", is a script provided to eCommerce merchants as "snap-sdk.js", for inclusion in their website. The script enables the merchant to include a Snap Checkout button on their website, enabling their customers to use Snap to finance their online purchase.

Snap Financeâ€™s WooCommerce checkout plugin offers an easy way to enable your WooCommerce powered eCommerce store to offer Lease to Buy finance options.
